Retailer should be given the provision to search an item based on multiple mode of approach

## Current End user challenges
   * Retailer has to search item one by one based on Wildcard search and place an order which leads to wrong selection of item (Human error) and its an time taking process which will make the retailer restless to use the application during the market time to place any order

## Barcode Based Item search

	Each Item stored in product master table should carry the correct Barcode code (EAN number).

## Manual Stock take via Retailer App
  * Enable the Retailers to capture the current stock position of the items in shelf / Backstore and generate the stock report 

## Automated Stock take (I.e Image Scan based stock take and OOS alerts to retailer)
Reference URL :
Object detection with deep learning and OpenCV - PyImageSearch

 * Enable the Retailers to scan the Item and identify the stock qty associated with that item image and pick the stock qty and add it to the current stock 
 * Out of stock items alert to be sent to the retailer to generate order recommendation
 
## Sales return / Damages 
  * Enable the Retailers to capture the Sales return and damages qty against the item along with return reasons / photo and generate the debit note for the same and share it with the distributor

 * Generated Debit note has to get  approved by the distributor and that should be made available for the retailer and added to his wallet , which can get  encashed against the outstanding bills 

## Item level Order recommendations based on current stock position & previous order qty
  * Based on Last 2 week Stock take / sales return / New Invoice qty , we can able to predict the total sales happened at the outlet in current week  and derive the Minimum order Qty (MOQ) as order recommendations for next week 

 * I.e Total Qty sold will be taken as MOQ for new order placement  

    - **Total Qty sold** = (Last week stock Position + New Stock inward) - (Current week stock Position) - (Last week Sales return Qty)
